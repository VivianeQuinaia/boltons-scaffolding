# Lescript

In this project you'll find the infamous **Lescript** and everything you need to build a 
skeleton use case in the architecture currently used by the Boltons House.

What this hopes to be:

* A way to speed up your coding by taking the usual structural code out of the way

What this is not:

* A production-ready code generator
* A panda

In the config.php file you'll find what you need to get started. When ready just open
a terminal and type:

`php Lescript.php`

---------------

##Known issues and limitations
* The LogInterface has no namespace assigned to it, you'll have to fix that yourself
* The code might not me properly formatted (CTRL+ALT+L in PHPStorm should fix it)
